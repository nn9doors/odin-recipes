    <img src="../images/cold cut.jpg" alt="The ideal sandwich?" width="500px">
    <h2>The perfect lunch and dinner</h2>
    <em>Prep time: 10 minutes. Cook time: 0 minutes</em>
    <p>The Cold Cut Combo is an excellent choice for a meal you have around 3pm. This footlong sub is easy as hell to make and will fill you up for the rest of the day.</p>
    <p>This is my personal recipe, but if you feel like you need to add something like tomatoes I guess you can feel free.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Classic italian sandwich loaf, 6 in or Footlong if you are super hungry</li>
        <li>Ham, Salami, and Bologna, thin sliced, 3 slices each</li>
        <li>White American cheese, 3 triangles</li>
        <li>Shredded iceberg lettuce, ~1 cup</li>
        <li>Thinly sliced red onion, 1/4 cup</li>
        <li>Pickle chips, handful</li>
        <li>A little, <strong>that means just a little,</strong> yellow mustard and mayo</li>
        <li>About 7-8 dollars</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Directions
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Find a Subway sandwich restaurant. This is one of the most ubiquitous fast food restaurants in America, and even if your town only has one gas station you probably won't have too much trouble finding one of these</li>
        <li>Go inside and when the person behind the counter asks, let him know you'd like a "footlong on italian" (or 6 inch if you just want a snack). He knows what this means. You can then specify you want a Cold Cut Combo</li>
        <li>When asked if you "want that toasted" say no</li>
        <li>When the person behind the counter asks, deliberately list off the ingredients "I'll have lettuce, onions, and pickles..."</li>
        <li>Finally, ask for <strong>LIGHT</strong> mustard and mayo. You can also say "easy on the mayo" if it makes you feel better.</li>
            <em>note: this will not change the outcome and you will end up wiping extra condiments off of your sandwich, so grab extra napkins.</em>
        <li>Finally, you may get chips and a drink if you want but it's best to just pay and leave quickly, half-running back to your car or home, to eat your sandwich in peace in front of the television or computer</li>
    </ol>
